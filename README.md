React Design Editor is a module for React, written in Javascript/Typescript which provides two primary features:

-   Image Editor - Create images in React, draw diagrams and arrange compositions using the image editor and save the result to one of several export formats, provides functionality similar to Powerpoint.
-   ~~Business Process Modelling (BPM) - Design flowcharts and process workflows in React and export the model to JSON, which can be imported into the tool (load/save).~~

The module primarily uses the [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/), [Fabric.js](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) libraries, but a full list of required dependencies can be found below.
